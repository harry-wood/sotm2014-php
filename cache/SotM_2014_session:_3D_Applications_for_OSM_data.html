</p><p>OpenStreetMap collects almost any kind of information on the structure of our physical world. Yet, most applications of that data are simply rendered 2D maps. These are not using the full potential of OSM to help better understand our world.
</p><p>We present two concepts for 3D applications of OSM data beyond simple maps: An abstract Street View is available for any point on Earth, and allows for free movement while preserving the privacy of individuals. And virtual apartment exploration enables the user to get a feeling for an apartment he wishes to rent as well as its surroundings without having to physically visit its location.
