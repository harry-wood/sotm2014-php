</p><p>This talk gives an overview about OSM Inspector, a QA tool that
has been with OSM for over six years and that is still being 
extended continuously. We'll not so much concern ourselves
with the actual QA checks that OSMI offers, but instead look
at the various technologies employed by OSMI to run its analyses,
some of which are still the same we coded six years ago, and
some already use more modern approaches. With its altogether five
different data sources, OSMI comprehensively illustrates
different ways of processing OSM data, and their respective
pros and cons.
