</p><p>In 2014 over 40 Dutch community members imported all Dutch addresses (8 mln) and buildings (10 mln). In this presentation you find out what it took to get there: meetings, discussions about tagging, decisions, communication, open data, tools and a vibrant community. Another relevant part is feedback to the government address and buildings database: is it time to drop SA or not? You will also be informed on the way the Dutch addresses and buildings will be kept up to date in the future as well as some suggestions which might benefit address and building imports in your community.
