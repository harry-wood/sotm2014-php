</p><p>This project is an initiative fostering the affirmation of local autonomous OSM communities in the French-speaking countries from the “South” as well as supporting and strengthening their rise. The project activities involve outreach, technical and organizational training and support, documentation sprints, software development and concrete mapping actions. It operates within the spirit and practices of free software movement coupled with a grassroots economy of means paired with voluntarism to build a replicable model in territories marked by poverty. These activities allow for a local and autonomous OSM ecosystem and OSM association to grow in every country the project has reached so far. Since 2012, the project has been involving Senegal, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, Ivory Coast, Chad and Niger and continuously extends its seeds.
