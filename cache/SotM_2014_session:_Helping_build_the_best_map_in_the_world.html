</p><p>The Mapbox data team continuously updates OpenStreetMap based on Mapbox customer feedback and systematic analysis of the map. Over the past two years, the data team has committed 50,000 changesets to the map, has helped import 1 million buildings in New York City, trace 150,000 buildings in San Francisco, fixed countless TIGER alignment issues in the United States and help put entire cities on the map in humanitarian crisis. And this is just the beginning. In this talk I will share how our data team contributes to OpenStreetMap, what tools we use, how we prioritize work, and how we interact with community. We see ourselves as part of this community and our biggest goal is to help create the best map in the world - all through open data.
