</p><p>Improving OpenStreetMap requires better data and more information. With the launch of WorldView-3, mappers around the world now have access to satellite imagery with higher resolution, improved accuracy and unique super spectral content. These attributes will unlock features in OpenStreetMap never (or rarely) seen before and take the map to a whole new level. Beyond satellite imagery, DigitalGlobe has launched a program that supports our vision of Seeing a Better World. The intended outcome is to save lives, resources and time by working with NGOs, Governments and commercial industry to create the most accurate map of the world.
