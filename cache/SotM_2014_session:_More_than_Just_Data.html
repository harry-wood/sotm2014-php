</p><p>This talk shines a light on how contributors to OpenStreetMap interact with one another on- and offline, focussing on behaviour that actually affects the data (rather than people discussing things on mailing lists).
</p><p>We will have a special look at contributions that have a negative impact, and discuss how the community can best deal with such in the future, when a growing OSM is likely to attract more problematic contributors.
</p><p>The author illustrates his talk with a couple of real-life case examples from his experience at OSMF's data working group, and if time permits, we might also have a discussion/BoF on the future of "policing" OSM.
