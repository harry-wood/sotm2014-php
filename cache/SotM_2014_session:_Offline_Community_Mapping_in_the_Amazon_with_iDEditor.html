</p><p><a class="external text" target="_top" href="http://www.digital-democracy.org">Digital Democracy</a> is developing an offline mapping stack based on <a class="external text" target="_top" href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD">iDEditor</a> for use by indigenous communities in the Amazon rainforest and around the world to map their territory and resources. We are building a distributed data model based on the OSM data model which allows peer-to-peer offline syncing, implemented in Node / LevelDB.
</p><p>We will demo our prototype web-based solution to community mapping needs which allows data entry and synchronization offline. We are building private geodatabases that share the OSM model and putting the power in the hands of local communities to decide how their data is shared and with who.
