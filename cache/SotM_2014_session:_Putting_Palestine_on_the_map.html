</p><p>Palestine is nearly invisible to the world, its existence erased politically, historically and cartographically.
</p><p>The streets have no names, but we are using OSM to create them.
</p><p>Ramallah Geography Collective focuses on educating the youth and people of Palestine to contribute to creating the map of their world and leave the mark of their existence.
</p><p>This presentation will focus on how average people with little means and little programming knowledge make the most of what they have to try and take our place to participate in the global community.
