</p><p>This talk examines the shape of our community, and the way it comes together, from the highly dedicated individuals who do the most, through to the brand new mappers who chip in a little bit, and all that's in between. Broadly speaking the shape of the OpenStreetMap is a "long tail". In this talk we'll take a close look at the long tail, and ponder the challenge of shifting the curve into a new shape. We'll see how the long tail explains lots of things, but we can't put everything on that curve, as we look at different sub-communities within OpenStreetMap and all of the exciting ways of contributing
