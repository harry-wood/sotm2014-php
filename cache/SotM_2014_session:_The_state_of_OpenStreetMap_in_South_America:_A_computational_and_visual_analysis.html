</p><p>Although largely neglected in previous studies, South America provides an informative landscape for studying OpenStreetMap growth patterns. OSM planet and history files reveal that South American countries widely vary in editors per capita, growth over time, and influence by nonlocal editors. In this talk, I demonstrate a website I have developed for visualizing OSM growth across South America. Through charts and animated maps, users of the site can compare OSM participation statistics from any two countries. I also share a computational analysis of languages used by OSM editors when commenting on changesets, revealing areas where substantial amounts of edits may be coming from nonlocal sources. These analyses illuminate places where OSM has thrived and places where it requires local nurturing.
