</p><p>Wikimaps is an initiative to allow users to upload historical maps to Wikimedia Commons and turn them into geodata. It combines the MapWarper of the New York Public Library and the OpenHistoricalMap project into one working environment, and hooks them to Wikimedia Commons, Wikipedia and Wikidata.
</p><p>With Wikimaps Expedition we want to put together collaborative practises from the Wikimedia GLAM activities, OpenHistoricalMap and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap. Doing historical mapping &amp; storytelling online and onsite, asynchronously and synchronously.
</p><p>In addition to a presentation, we propose a workshop spanning the duration of the community days. The workshop will combine warping historical maps, doing historical mapping from them and pulling different information together by adding maps and images to Wikipedia articles.
